#Wilcoxon signed-rank test, following the example from http://rcompanion.org/rcompanion/d_10.html
#As per, http://www.biostathandbook.com/wilcoxonsignedrank.html , Use the Wilcoxon signed-rank test when there are two nominal variables and one measurement variable. One of the nominal variables has only two values, such as "before" and "after," and the other nominal variable often represents individuals. This is the non-parametric analogue to the paired tâ€“test, and you should use it if the distribution of differences between pairs is severely non-normally distributed.
#Since multiple comparisons, Bonferroni correction: 0.05(initial alpha)/7 (total measurements) = 0.0071
